Magic Square Systems staff training: searchable table listing

# Instructions
A client maintains a spreadsheet of orders that shows the products that have been purchased by their customers. Each time a product is purchased, a new row is entered onto the spreadsheet. The client would like you to produce an online system that displays these orders in a web page. They would like to be able to filter the orders by customer and product.

1. Using SQL Server, create an entity relationship database that can be used to store the customers and order records
2. Populate the database with orders from the spreadsheet
3. Create a web page that displays the orders in a table
4. Add a search form to the page allowing the user to filter by customer and/or product code

# Prerequisites
You will need to be setup with the following to complete this task:
1. SQL Server 2019 or higher
2. Visual Studio 2019 or higher
3. ASP.NET 4.8 or higher
4. Internet Information Services (IIS) or personal webserver for running/testing/debugging your work

# Get started
This repository is a sample MVC application, simply clone the repo to get started. The database and spreadsheet are located in the Data folder. You'll be expected to use entity framework to complete the solution.

Once you have created your orders web page, push a new branch using this format: review/your_name (e.g. review/joe_bloggs)
