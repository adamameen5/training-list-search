Magic Square Systems staff training: searchable table listing

# Instructions
A client maintains a spreadsheet of orders that shows the products that have been purchased by their customers. Each time a product is purchased, a new row is entered onto the spreadsheet. The client would like you to produce an online system that displays these orders in a web page. They would like to be able to filter the orders by customer and product.

1. Using SQL Server, create an entity relationship database that can be used to record the customers and their orders
2. Populate the database with orders from the spreadsheet
3. Display the orders table in a web page
4. Allow the user to filter orders by customer name and/or product code

# Prerequisites
You will need to be setup with the following to complete this task:
1. SQL Server 2019 or higher
2. Visual Studio 2019 or higher
3. ASP.NET 4.8 or higher
4. Internet Information Services (IIS) or personal webserver for testing/debugging

# Get started
This repository is a sample MVC application, simply clone the repo to get started. The database and spreadsheet are located in the Data folder.

Once you have created your orders page, push a new branch using this format: review/your_name (e.g. review/joe_bloggs)
